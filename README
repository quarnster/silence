silence
----------------

silence is an effort to create a xm/mod/mp3 player to be
used in games and demos/intros.

Currently it is only a layer between Java and FMOD, Bass or Midas,
but the work to create a 100% pure Java player has begun.

Please note, just because silence is licensed under the GNU LGPL
does not mean that FMOD, Midas, BASS and MuhmuAudio are (ok, MuhmuAudio
acctually is licensed under the GNU LGPL :) ). Please read the licenses
for these devices before using silence with them.
