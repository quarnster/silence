Some libraries are also used by silence. In the "README" file you can see a list
of these libraries and their respective homepages. Please go to the hompages of
the libraries to see whom wrote them.

Also the following text documents have been very helpful in the develop of mod
playing capabilities:

fmoddoc.txt and fs3mdoc.txt by Brett Paterson
modfil11.txt by "Thunder" and Erland Van Olmen
xm-form.txt by Matti Hamalainen
xm.txt by Fredrik Huss
