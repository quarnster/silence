This file will help you compile the nativelibs for
silence. This is a guide for Win32 users only, if
you use UNIX and don't know how to compile and
create libraries, then you're not ready for it.

What you need
------------------

First of all you need to download the library you wish
to use. See README for the hompage urls.

I will use the Borland free commandline tools for this
guide. It will probably work with other compilers but
then you will get no help from me.
Download the borland free commandline tools from

http://www.borland.com/bcppbuilder/freecompiler/


Creating the import libraries
------------------------------

Now that you have downloaded the library you wish to use
it is time to create the import libraries for the build
process.

implib bass.lib bass.dll
implib fmod.lib fmod.dll
implib midas.lib midas11.dll

Put all the .lib files in the source directory for silence.


Compiling the dlls
--------------------

First of all you must configure the compiler and linker so
that they will find the include files and standard libraries.
Please consult the documentation provided by Borland on how
to do this.

To compile, we will use the make utility that is included
with the Borland free command line tools. Enter the source
directory and copy Makefile.bcc32 to Makefile. Now type:

make nativelibs

If all went well you should now see three dlls in
the source directory: msilence.dll, fsilence.dll and bsilence.dll

If you don't want to use all the libraries you can compile
the files manually. For example if you wish to compile and
link the fmod device type:

bcc32 -P -w- -c silence\devices\fmod\fmodglue.c
ilink32 /aa /Tpd c0d32.obj fmodglue.obj,fsilence.dll,,fmod.lib import32.lib cw32.lib, fsilence.def

Read more about compiling and linking in the Borland documents.
