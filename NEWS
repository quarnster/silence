in 0.0.3:
	- Lots of fixes. This is actually the first version I'm pleased with.
	- New syncsystem
	- Fmod, Bass, Midas and MuhmuAudio are no longer shipped with the releases.
	  You'll have to download these then compile the layers to them on
	  your own. Read the GUIDE file for a little help with the process.

in 0.0.2:

	- Added BassDevice
	- Added MuhmuDevice
	- Started the work on the 100% pure java xm player
	- fixes, etc, etc
